# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression
This is a simple house price prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm (Linear Regression) .

ML/Linear Regression 
-> Linear Regression perform the task to predict a dependent variable value(y) based on a given independent variable (x).
   So , this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x(input) and y(output). 

Hypothesis function for Linear regression: 
   Y = mX + c     (m - slope , c - intercepts )
   
   While traning the model we are given : 
   X : input training data (univarate - one input variable (parameter))
   Y : labels to data (supervised learning)).
   
   When training the Model - it fits the best line to predicts the value of Y for a given of x . The model gets the best regression fit line 
   by finding the best m and c values . Once we find the best m and c values , we get the best fit line . So , when we are finally using our model 
   for prediction , it will predict the value of Y for the input values of X.
